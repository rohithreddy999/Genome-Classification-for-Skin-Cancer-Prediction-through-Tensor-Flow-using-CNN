# Genome-Classification-for-Skin-Cancer-Prediction-through-Tensor-Flow-using-CNN
Genome classification for skin cancer prediction can be performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in Tensor Flow.CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks such as identifying cancerous cells in skin tissue samples.The Tensor Flow framework provides a convenient and efficient way to build, train, and evaluate CNN models for genome classification.
